# Smart Driver Assignment Testing Guide

## How to Test the New Features

### 1. Testing Smart Driver Assignment Modal

**Prerequisites:**
- Be logged in as an Admin user
- Have at least one shipment without an assigned driver
- Have at least one available driver in the system

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to any shipment details page (`/shipments/{id}`)
2. Click the "Quick Assign" button
3. The Smart Driver Assignment Modal should open showing:
   - Priority selector (Balanced, Distance, Experience, Rating, Availability)
   - Auto Assign button
   - List of driver recommendations with scores and details
   - Manual assign buttons for each recommended driver

**Expected Behavior:**
- Modal loads driver recommendations automatically
- Priority selector changes recommendations when modified
- Auto assign button assigns the best driver and closes modal
- Manual assign buttons assign specific drivers
- Loading states show during API calls

### 2. Testing Smart Assignment Page

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to any unassigned shipment details page
2. Click the "Smart Assignment Page" button
3. You should be taken to `/shipments/{id}/smart-assign`
4. The page should show:
   - Shipment information at the top
   - AI Recommendations panel on the left
   - All Available Drivers panel on the right
   - "Open Smart Assignment" button to open the modal

**Expected Behavior:**
- Page loads shipment data and recommendations
- Both panels show relevant driver information
- Assignment buttons work from both panels
- Modal can be opened from the button
- Navigation back to shipment details works

### 3. Testing Available Drivers Page

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/drivers` (Admin only)
2. The page should show:
   - List of all drivers with their availability status
   - Refresh button to update driver data
   - Filter toggle for "Available Only"
   - Driver details sidebar when selecting a driver

**Expected Behavior:**
- All drivers load with current status
- Clicking on a driver shows details in sidebar
- Refresh button reloads driver data
- Filter toggle works correctly
- Driver selection callbacks work if enabled

### 4. Testing Navigation

**Steps:**
1. Log in as Admin
2. Check the navigation menu (both desktop and mobile)
3. "Drivers" link should be visible and functional
4. Navigate to drivers page and verify access

### 5. Testing Shipments List Integration

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/shipments`
2. Look for shipments without assigned drivers
3. "Assign" button should be visible in the actions column
4. Click the button to navigate to smart assignment page

## API Testing Scenarios

### Test Driver Recommendations API
```bash
GET /api/shipments/{shipmentId}/driver-recommendations?priority=Balanced
```
**Expected Response:** Array of driver recommendations with scores

### Test Smart Assignment API
```bash
POST /api/shipments/{shipmentId}/smart-assign
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "useAutoAssignment": true,
  "priority": "Balanced",
  "maxRecommendations": 5
}
```
**Expected Response:** Assigned driver object or recommendations array

### Test Available Drivers API
```bash
GET /api/shipments/available-drivers
```
**Expected Response:** Array of drivers with availability details

## Error Scenarios to Test

### 1. No Available Drivers
- Remove all drivers or set all to unavailable
- Test that appropriate "No drivers available" messages show

### 2. API Errors
- Test with invalid shipment IDs
- Test with network disconnection
- Verify error messages display correctly

### 3. Permission Tests
- Try accessing admin-only features as Customer or Driver
- Verify proper access restrictions

### 4. Edge Cases
- Test with shipments that already have drivers assigned
- Test with very long driver names or addresses
- Test responsive behavior on mobile devices
